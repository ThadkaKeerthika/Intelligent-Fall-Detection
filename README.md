### Intelligent Fall Detection Monitoring Using Computer Vision

Category: Computer Vision

Skills Required: Python, Open CV, Twilio

Project Description:

Fall events are important health issues in people like kids, elders etc. When people fall it is particularly serious and often leads to injury or death. That is why automatic monitoring has an important role in-home care and care centres. The fear of falling leads to restricted ADL/IADL (activities of daily living/ instrumental activities of daily living). The fear is justified, fall-related injuries are among the five most causes of death for the population. If falls would be detected the patient could be provided with in-time medical treatment. In-time medical treatment could save lives.

In this guided project we will be using a video stream to detect the posture of the person with the help of computer vision. If a falling posture is detected then a notification will be sent to the caretaker using Twilio service. Whenever caretakers receive the mobile notifications they can take necessary actions.
